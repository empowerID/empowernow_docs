I’m going to consolidate the three marketing plans into one unified message, then outline the site IA/content map, SEO/CTAs, homepage copy, and a 60-day launch plan.

I consolidated the three marketing plans into a unified positioning, site IA/content map, homepage copy draft, SEO/CTA guidance, and a 60-day launch plan. Now I’ll mark the planning tasks complete.

### Unified ARIA marketing message
- EmpowerNow ARIA: the Identity Fabric for AI Agents. Mint verifiable agent identities, authorize with a standard, enforce at the boundary, and prove every action.
- Pillars:
  - Identity (IdP): ARIA Passports with RAR/DPoP, pairwise identities, plan JWS, schema pins, optional identity chaining.
  - Authorization (PDP): AuthZEN-native decisions with constraints/obligations, enriched by Membership graph (data scope, step-up, chaining).
  - Enforcement (Gateways): MCP-aware PEP and BFF spending control: schema pins, params/egress allowlists, plan/step verification, idempotent budgets, cryptographic receipts.
  - Truth Graph (Membership): Delegations, capabilities, budgets/max_steps, and SaaS eligibility as a single source of truth powering IdP and PDP.

### Public site IA and content map
- Homepage
  - Hero: “Make AI agents safe, affordable, and auditable”
  - 4 Pillars: Identity, Authorization, Enforcement, Truth Graph
  - Demo CTA + Quickstart CTA
  - Proof: standards alignment (AuthZEN/OAuth/MCP), receipts, customer/analyst quotes
  - Architecture snapshot: IdP → PDP → ARIA Gateway/BFF → Tool Registry/Receipts, backed by Membership
- Product
  - ARIA Overview (the fabric; end-to-end diagram, outcomes, KPIs)
  - IdP: Agent Passports (RAR/DPoP/plan/schema pins; identity chaining)
  - PDP: AuthZEN constraints/obligations; Membership-powered decisions
  - ARIA Gateway (MCP): schema pinning, allowlists, plan/budget enforcement, receipts
  - BFF: stream-time enforcement, spend caps, receipts
  - Tool Registry: pins, rollout windows, ETags
  - Receipt Vault: signed hash-chained receipts, optional KMS anchoring
- Solutions
  - FinOps governance: enforce budgets, receipts for reconciliation
  - Regulated industries: auditability, data-scope, step-up, receipts
  - SaaS platform teams: MCP control, identity chaining, egress pinning
- Docs
  - Quickstart (docker compose; Postman/curl)
  - API: `/access/v1/evaluation`, `/mcp/{tool}`, ARIA claims
  - Guides: “Agent Passports”, “Identity Chaining”, “Membership PIP”
- Resources
  - Blog series (AuthZEN PEP for agents; enforced budgets; receipts; MCP)
  - Whitepaper and 10-min demo
  - Analyst brief and architecture deck
- Company
  - About, press, trust/security

### Homepage copy (draft)
- Hero: EmpowerNow ARIA — Make AI agents safe, affordable, and auditable
  - Subtext: Mint verifiable agent identities, authorize with AuthZEN, enforce at the tool boundary, and prove every action with cryptographic receipts.
  - CTAs: Book a demo | Try the quickstart
- Pillars
  - Identity (IdP): ARIA Passports with plan JWS, schema pins, DPoP; optional identity chaining
  - Authorization (PDP): AuthZEN decisions with constraints/obligations, backed by Membership
  - Enforcement (Gateway/BFF): MCP-aware control, plan/budgets, params/egress, receipts
  - Truth Graph (Membership): Delegations, capabilities, budgets, and data-scope
- Proof points
  - Standards: AuthZEN, OAuth Token Exchange, RAR, DPoP, MCP
  - Receipts: signed and hash-chained; optional KMS anchor
  - Demo: deny-before-call, 402 budget_exceeded, receipts chain
- Architecture: small diagram; link to ARIA overview

### SEO targets and CTAs
- Primary keywords: AI agent authorization, agentic AI governance, AuthZEN PEP, MCP gateway, AI spend enforcement, cryptographic receipts
- Secondary: OAuth on-behalf-of agents, DPoP agent tokens, schema pinning, plan contracts, AI data egress allowlist
- Primary CTA: Book a demo
- Secondary CTAs: Try quickstart | Read the whitepaper | View the demo

### 60-day launch plan
- Weeks 1–2
  - Ship ARIA landing + homepage updates
  - Docs quickstart; “Agent Passports” guide; PDP + Membership PIP examples
  - Demo stabilization (compose, scripts, receipts viewer)
- Weeks 3–4
  - Publish blog series (AuthZEN PEP; enforced budgets; receipts; MCP enforcement)
  - Whitepaper + 10-min narrated demo
  - PR outreach and ARIA overview webinar
- Weeks 5–6
  - Analyst briefings; acquirer outreach with tailored 1-pagers
  - Lighthouse pilots (FinOps and regulated)
  - Case-study drafts from pilots

### Content production checklist
- ARIA landing page (Identity, Authorization, Enforcement, Truth Graph)
- “Agent Passports” explainer with ARIA claim examples and DPoP notes
- PDP page: Membership-powered constraints (data_scope SQL, identity_chain TTL)
- Gateway page: MCP schema pins, egress/params, plan/budget receipts
- Quickstart, Postman/curl, demo video, whitepaper, analyst brief

- I unified the message across IdP/PDP/Gateway/Membership, designed the www structure, drafted homepage copy, set SEO/CTAs, and scheduled a 60-day launch plan.
