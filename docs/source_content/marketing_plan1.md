I'll scan the ARIA-related design docs in `source_content` and search for "ARIA" mentions, then read the most relevant files to synthesize positioning and a go-to-market plan.

[5 tools called]

I read the ARIA v1 design docs in `source_content` (Gateway/PEP, PDP, BFF, Tool Registry, marketability) and synthesized a go-to-market and visibility plan aligned to the technical wedge: AuthZEN-native agent authorization, enforceable per-agent budgets/plan contracts, MCP-aware control at the tool boundary, and cryptographic receipts.

### Positioning and narrative
- Elevators
  - EmpowerNow ARIA: Authorization and spend governance for AI agents. Enforce policy and budgets on every tool call, prove it with cryptographic receipts.
  - The AuthZEN-native MCP Gateway for enterprise AI. Bind agents to users, enforce plan contracts and egress allowlists, and integrate any PDP.
- Category framing
  - Authorization for AI agents (AuthZEN PEP for MCP tools)
  - AI Spend Governance and Audit (budget enforcement + verifiable receipts)
- Why we win
  - User-bound agent identity on-wire (pairwise binding) vs “anonymous gateway”
  - Hard budget enforcement and plan-step contracts vs cost “estimates”
  - MCP-aware PEP: schema pins, param allowlists, egress controls before execution
  - Cryptographically signed, hash-chained receipts for provable audit
  - Bring-your-PDP (AuthZEN standard) with constraints/obligations

### Messaging by persona
- CTO/CISO: Prevent tool misuse and data egress, standardize policy via AuthZEN, prove every decision with receipts.
- CFO/FinOps: Cap and enforce per-agent spend with approvals and receipts; eliminate runaway costs.
- Platform/Infra: Drop-in gateway + registry, short TTL decision cache, ETag’d catalog, docker-compose quickstart.
- DevSecOps: MCP schema pinning, param allowlists, egress allowlists, step-up MFA, identity chaining (FF).

### Differentiated proof points
- AuthZEN PEP integration (+ PDP compatibility mode)
- Plan contracts + idempotent budget debit; 402 budget_exceeded with receipts
- MCP schema pins and rollout windows (atomic CURRENT flips)
- Signed, hash-chained receipts; optional daily KMS anchoring
- Optional OAuth identity chaining via EmpowerNow IdP (feature-flagged)

### Analyst and press plan
- Targets: Gartner (AI TRiSM, Identity Fabric, API Security), Forrester (Zero Trust, AI Security), 451/GigaOm/Omdia, RedMonk (DevEx), The New Stack.
- Briefing kit (20–30 mins):
  - 1-pager positioning, AuthZEN alignment, differentiation vs AI Gateways
  - Architecture slide: IdP passports → ARIA PEP → PDP → Tool Registry → Receipts
  - 5-minute live demo (deny-before-call, budget cap, signed receipt)
  - Customer-style storyboard (FinOps + regulated workload)
- Thought leadership
  - “Authorization for AI Agents: An AuthZEN-native PEP for MCP”
  - “From estimated cost to enforced budgets for AI”
  - “Provable AI: Cryptographic receipts for audit and compliance”

### Acquirer heatmap (why they care)
- Cloud & edge: Cloudflare, Akamai (add authorization and spend enforcement to AI Gateways)
- Identity/security: Okta/Auth0, CyberArk, Zscaler, Palo Alto (agent identity + PEP + receipts)
- Observability: Datadog, Elastic, Splunk (receipts + budget events + MCP awareness)
- Cloud platforms: Microsoft/Azure, AWS, Google (AuthZEN/MCP alignment, enterprise controls)
- Data/AI platforms: Snowflake, Databricks (data-scope enforcement + receipts)
- Model/agent ecosystems: Anthropic/OpenAI (MCP PEP for enterprise control)

### Launch plan (60 days)
- Weeks 1–2: Name and copy unification; ARIA landing page; docs quickstart; demo stabilization
  - Standardize “ARIA Gateway (MCP-aware PEP)”, “ARIA Passports (IdP)”, “AuthZEN PDP”, “Tool Registry”, “BFF”
  - Add OpenAPI/JSON samples for `/access/v1/evaluation` and `/mcp/{tool_id}`
  - Website hero refresh and dedicated ARIA page with analyst-ready messaging and CTAs
- Weeks 3–4: Public tech launch
  - Publish ARIA whitepaper + quickstart; blog series on budgets, receipts, MCP enforcement
  - Reference integrations: Azure Prompt Shields, Bedrock Guardrails as inputs (constraints), not decisions
  - Seed GitHub demo repo with docker-compose (IdP, PDP, ARIA, Registry, Receipts, sample tools)
- Weeks 5–6: Analyst/BD sprints, lighthouse pilots
  - Brief 6–8 analysts; push a 10-minute narrated demo video
  - Run 2–3 pilots highlighting spend enforcement + audit chain
  - Outbound BD to acquirer list with tailored 1-pagers

### Demo storyline and assets
- Story: Agent for a user tries three tools (billing.pay, github.create-issue, drive.search)
  - Plan contracts enforced: wrong step → 403 plan_step_violation
  - Budget cap hit → 402 budget_exceeded; receipt recorded with reason
  - Egress allowlist violation → 403 egress_denied
  - Happy path → Allow; signed receipt stored; show chain continuity
- Assets
  - docker-compose up
  - Postman collection or `curl` scripts for each step
  - Receipts viewer (simple UI) to show hash chain and policy snapshot
  - Metrics dashboard: mcp.requests_total, denies_total{reason}, receipt.emit_ms

### Website and content updates
- Create `ARIA` landing: “Make AI agents safe, affordable, and auditable”
  - Pillars: Authorization (AuthZEN), Spend Governance, MCP Control, Verifiable Audit
  - Primary CTAs: “Book a demo”, “Try the quickstart”
- Cross-link docs ↔ site; add SEO (MCP gateway, AuthZEN PDP, AI budget enforcement, cryptographic receipts)
- Fix canonical references; render diagrams; consolidate CSS; mobile-ready PDP/CRUD pages
- Add solution briefs (FinOps, Regulated industries, SaaS platform teams)

### Packaging and pricing (suggested)
- Community: ARIA Gateway + Tool Registry + PDP client, single-tenant, no KMS anchoring
- Team: Adds budget dashboards, signed receipts, LDAP/OIDC integration
- Enterprise: KMS anchoring, identity chaining, SSO/SAML, RBAC admin, multi-region, premium SLAs
- Pricing anchors: per-agent monthly + usage bands; volume discounts; security/compliance add-ons

### KPIs to track
- Pipeline: demo requests, pilot commits, time-to-pilot
- Product: deny-before-call rate, budget_exceeded events, average decision latency
- Adoption: stars/visits on quickstart, ARIA page CTR, doc dwell time
- Outcomes: pilots → paid conversions; analyst mentions; inbound BD interest

### Risks and mitigations
- Provider cost variance → position ARIA as enforcer of budgets, reconcile to provider invoices
- Guardrail false positives → treat as obligations/constraints with step-up, not core denies
- MCP adoption variance → keep generic HTTP tool path alongside MCP, highlight MCP when present
- PDP diversity → ship “Bring Your PDP” examples (TOPAZ/OPA bridge)

### Immediate execution checklist (next 2 weeks)
- Unify naming and copy across docs/site; create ARIA landing page
- Publish quickstart (compose + sample tools + receipts viewer)
- Add OpenAPI/JSON snippets and constraints schema docs
- Record 10-min demo; prep analyst briefing deck; schedule briefings
- Outbound BD to top 8 acquirer targets with 1-pagers and demo link

Summary
- ARIA’s defensible wedge: AuthZEN-native agent authorization, enforceable budgets/plan contracts, MCP-aware PEP, and cryptographic receipts.
- Shift messaging to “Authorization and Spend Governance for AI Agents,” with analysts, acquirers, and buyers aligned to those proof points.
- Execute a 60-day launch: unify naming, ship quickstart + demo, brief analysts, run pilots, and build a strong acquisition narrative.
