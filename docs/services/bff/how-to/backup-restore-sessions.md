title: Backup and Restore Sessions (Redis)
---

Strategy

- Use Redis persistence (AOF/RDB) in your environment or managed Redis with backups.
- Since sessions are ephemeral, disaster recovery can favor rapid reâ€‘login over restoration; choose based on UX.

Steps

1) Enable persistence in Redis or configure managed backups
2) Document TTLs and acceptable session loss window
3) Test restore by simulating Redis replacement
