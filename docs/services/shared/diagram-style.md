## Diagram style guide (Mermaid)

Use Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams. Keep labels concise; wrap with `<br/>` for line breaks. Avoid custom colors; rely on defaults for consistency.

### Patterns
- Flowchart LR for transport and catalog flows
- Graph TD for highâ€‘level component diagrams

### Example
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Client --> BFF
  BFF --> CRUD
  CRUD --> Generator
  CRUD --> Catalogue
```
