## Patent #1: User-Bound Agent Tokening

### Title
**Per-User Agent Identity with Cryptographic Binding for Multi-Tenant AI Systems**

### Technical Problem
Current AI systems use monolithic service identities accessing multiple users' data, creating:
- Cross-user data contamination risks (e.g., Chevrolet chatbot $1 car incident)
- No cryptographic enforcement of user-agent relationships
- Inability to revoke individual delegations without affecting all users
- Ambiguous audit trails that cannot distinguish user-specific operations

### Core Innovation
A cryptographically bound, pairwise agent identity system creating unique agent instances per user-service relationship with triple-consistency verification.

### Technical Implementation
```
Agent Identity Format: agent:{service_id}:for:{pairwise_identifier}
Pairwise Derivation: SHA256(user_id || service_id || tenant_salt)[:16]

Verification Algorithm:
1. Extract agent_id from act.sub claim
2. Verify format: agent:{service}:for:{identifier}
3. Confirm bound_sub == token.sub
4. Validate pairwise identifier matches derivation
5. Reject on any mismatch
```

### Representative Claims

**Independent Claim 1 (Method)**
A computer-implemented method for secure agent delegation comprising:
- generating a pairwise agent identifier derived from a cryptographic function of user identity and service identity;
- issuing a delegation token containing:
  - a subject claim identifying the user
  - an actor claim identifying the user-bound agent instance
  - a binding claim establishing the cryptographic relationship
- verifying at a policy enforcement point that:
  - the actor identifier corresponds to the claimed user binding
  - the pairwise derivation is mathematically consistent
- rejecting requests upon binding violation

**System Claim**
A gateway system comprising processors configured to generate, validate, and enforce user-bound agent identities per claim 1.

**Medium Claim**
Non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions for performing the method of claim 1.
