## Targets (guidance)

- Widget bundle: < 50 KB gzipped
- Page bundle: < 100 KB gzipped
- First render: < 1s on baseline hardware

## Tips

- Dynamic import for heavy components; lazy routes
- Memoize expensive trees; virtualize long lists
- Prefer lightweight charts/libs; treeâ€‘shakable ESM only
- Cache data with React Query; tune stale times per view

## Checks

- Add a build step to report bundle sizes; fail CI on regressions
- Measure with Lighthouse or RUM in staging before rollout
