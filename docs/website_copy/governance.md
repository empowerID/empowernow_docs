# Governance — Page Ownership & Review

## Ownership
- Assign owners per section (Homepage, Product, Solutions, Docs, Resources, Pricing, Trust, Company)
- Central editorial owner for tone and consistency

## Review cadence
- Weekly content review; monthly SEO review; quarterly overhaul
- 48‑hour SLA for content updates

## Change log
- Track changes per page; include rationale and links to issues

## Source mapping
- Tie each page to source design docs and API references to avoid drift
