# Solution — SaaS Platform Teams

## The problem
Embedding AI agents into your product means calling many tools and SaaS APIs safely. You need standard policy enforcement, schema integrity, auditable actions, and optional identity chaining.

## The ARIA approach
- MCP‑aware PEP with schema pins and rollout windows
- Params and egress allowlists by tool; deny before execution
- Optional identity chaining under PDP constraints (allowed audiences/scopes, TTL)
- Signed receipts for every permitted call

## Outcomes
- Safer SaaS/API integrations with verifiable controls
- Faster partner/tool onboarding using schema pins and ETags
- Lower integration risk with standard AuthZEN decisions and receipts

## Getting started
- Catalog tools in the Registry; pin schemas and set grace windows
- Author PDP constraints for egress/params and (optionally) identity chaining
- Wire ARIA Gateway as the PEP for agent→tool calls
