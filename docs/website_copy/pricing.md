## FAQs

What’s included in Community?
- Core runtime enforcement (Gateway), Registry read path, PDP client, and the quickstart so you can evaluate ARIA locally.

Can we bring our own PDP?
- Yes. ARIA consumes AuthZEN‑profiled decisions and works with compatible PDPs.

Do you support signed receipts?
- Yes in Team and Enterprise via the Receipt Vault.

Do you support identity chaining?
- Yes in Enterprise. It’s feature‑flagged at the IdP and gated by PDP constraints.

How do we get started?
- Try the quickstart, then book a demo for a guided pilot.
