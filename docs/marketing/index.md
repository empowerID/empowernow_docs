description: Internal marketing playbook for EmpowerNow Identity Fabric. Positioning, GTM, packaging, pricing, personas, and competitive notes.
---

This section is for internal marketing content that we can later adapt into public web pages. It consolidates positioning, messaging, packaging/pricing, personas, and competitive guidance grounded in real capabilities of the Identity Fabric.

What to read next:

- Positioning and Narrative: `marketing/positioning`
- Headline Differentiator: `marketing/experience-app`
- Go‑to‑Market Plan: `marketing/go-to-market`
- Packaging & Pricing: `marketing/packaging-pricing`
- Personas & Messaging: `marketing/personas`
- Competitive Landscape: `marketing/competitive`
- Studio ↔ Backend mapping: `marketing/studio-backend-mapping`
- Naming Service One‑Pager: `marketing/naming-service`

## Headline differentiator: Experience App

The Experience app is our unified, PDP‑aware end‑user portal. It turns the Identity Fabric into a live product surface with runtime module activation (via `/api/configs/ui` + SSE), a CSP‑safe plugin model, and a zero‑token SPA pattern through the BFF. Start here for the story we want to tell externally: `marketing/experience-app`.
