Notes

- We should expect continued consolidation and convergence on OpenID AuthZEN semantics and discovery. Competitors in PDP will strengthen interop stories rapidly; our advantage is a provable end‑to‑end fabric with BFF‑mediated zero‑token SPAs, Studios, and CAEP/observability baked in.
- Keep this honest: for app‑only teams that “just need decisions,” a specialized PDP (Aserto/Cerbos/Permit.io) can be the fastest path. Our differentiation matters when buyers want one control plane for AuthN+AuthZ+Automation+Inventory with runtime UI, hybrid connectivity, and measurable evidence.
