title: Positioning & Narrative
description: Core positioning for EmpowerNow Identity Fabric and the Studios.
---

EmpowerNow delivers an Identity Fabric that lets enterprises Discover → Authenticate → Authorize → Automate every identity interaction. The fabric is composed of Studios (frontends) backed by services (backends), shipped with Analytics and full Observability.

Why we win (grounded in code):

- Zero‑token SPAs via BFF session termination and ForwardAuth
- OpenID AuthZEN‑compliant PDP with batch evaluation and explainability
- Policy‑guarded automation with DPoP, CAEP events and OTEL/Prometheus
- Kafka → ClickHouse analytics with Learning Mode
- Azure Relay hybrid connectivity patterns for on‑prem without inbound ports

Primary messages by Studio:

- Authentication Studio (IdP + BFF): Passwordless, adaptive auth, CAEP, self‑host or SaaS
- Authorization Studio (PDP): &lt; 20 ms decisions, delegation graphs, auditors get diagrams
- Automation Studio (CRUD): No‑code workflows secured by policy, with AI nodes
- Inventory Studio (DataCollector): No‑code connectors, PDP‑gated deltas, visual diffs
- Governance Studio (EA): Reviews, SoD, certifications (design‑partner program)
