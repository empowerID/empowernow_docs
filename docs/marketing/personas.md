Primary buyers:

- CISO / VP Security: Risk reduction, auditability, zero‑trust; lead with Authorization Studio + Analytics + Observability
- Cloud Security Architect / Platform Engineering: Standardize authZ with AuthZEN PDP; adopt BFF to remove browser token risk; Infrastructure‑as‑Policy
- IGA Director / IAM Manager (IGA/PAM): Naming Service + Inventory Studio; Governance Studio EA roadmap; audit‑ready workflows and reviews

Automation buyers (new motion):

- IT Operations / Service Management: Replace ad‑hoc scripts and brittle automations; PDP‑guarded no‑code with CAEP/OTEL
- Application Owners: Secure internal automations and data syncs; leverage AI nodes with policy guardrails

Messaging by Studio:

- Authentication Studio: Zero‑token SPAs via BFF, passkeys out of the box, CAEP for SOC visibility
- Authorization Studio: Central policy brain; &lt; 20 ms; explainability for auditors; batch eval for APIs
- Automation Studio: No‑code that security approves—DPoP, PDP checks, full audit trail
- Inventory Studio: Discover and reconcile with dry‑run safety and PDP‑gated deltas
- Governance Studio (EA): Faster, provable reviews and SoD with graph context
- Naming Service: Enterprise naming at scale; YAML policies, plugins, internationalization, uniqueness guarantees
